# Thai-Sign-Language üí≠
This project aims to develop a Thai Sign Language detection using a Transformer-based model.

## code </>
### Model Files
- **model.tflite**: This model was trained using the `TSL-transformer-training.ipynb` notebook.
- **model-withflip.tflite**: This model was trained with additional data augmentation (flipping) using the `TSL-withflip-transformer-training.ipynb` notebook.

### Data Processing
- **parquetdata_visualize.ipynb**: This notebook explains how the data was processed and visualized before being used for model training.

## app üöÄ
You can try the thai sign language detection app through this link:

Linküîó : [Thai Sign Language Detection App](https://thai-sign-language-r39hfekjqvt7ykmfh2nj5y.streamlit.app/)

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the app locally to try real-time thai sign language detection app:
```sh
streamlit run real_time_app.py
```
